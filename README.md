# PGM_imageAnalysis_C
Using example datasets, for a school project by pairs, we must make a program able to detect rings and say if they are conform to the norm or not. 

### Usage
In the terminal of a linux distribution (if you are using windows you can download Ubuntu in the microsoft store or use a VM with virtualbox) enter those commands :
```
    #download the repository
    $ git clone https://github.com/Godeta/PGM_imageAnalysis_C.git

    #go inside the folder
    $ cd PGM_imageAnalysis_C

    # compile the program and execute the tests
    $ make
    
    # start the program on a specific image
    $ ./analyser filepath

    # (optionnal) erase the unused compiled files
    $ make clean

    # (optionnal) compile only the tests
    $ make tests
```
